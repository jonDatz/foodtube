## Acknowledgments
* Monoton font (used in our logo) was designed by Vernon Adams. Vernon practiced typeface design from 2007 to 2014. A lifelong artist, during this time he eagerly explored designing type for the cloud-based era. His work spans all genres, from lively script faces to workhorse text families and operating system UI. Vernon graduated with an MA in Typeface Design from the University of Reading and lives in California. His designs are mostly published as open source Google Fonts and his favorite projects include Oxygen Mono, Monda, and Bowlby One.

* Animate.css was created by Daniel Eden.  It is a cross-browser plug-and-play CSS animation library for delightful animation in websites and web applications.
